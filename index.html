                            This project was completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development 
                            certification. The goal was to create a calculator page that allows the user to 
                            add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. There also had
                            to be a button that clears the field displaying the numbers and operations. Finally,
                            the user must be able to chain operations, i.e. to continue inputing more operations
                            until the equals button is hit and still get the correct answer.
                            <br><br>
                            As a challenge to myself, I decided to complete this project without jQuery. This is
                            because at this point I knew more about how large jQuery was and how it was a bit 
                            excessive for a project of this type. I also didn't use Bootstrap and tried to use
                            mainly relative lengths so that the project would be more responsive. Once the basic
                            HTML and CSS were written, I added event listeners to all of the buttons in order to 
                            display the charcter of the button in the output field. The only buttons that don't 
                            do this are the 'AC' and 'CE' buttons, which clear the entire field and the last 
                            outputed string, respectively, and the '=' button. This final button calls the needed
                            functions to actually evaluate the expression that the user has created. The calculator
                            evaluates the expression from left-to-right.

                            This project was completed for the FreeCodeCamp Front-End certificate. The objective 
                            was to build a page that connected to the Twitch API to fetch information about 
                            various streamers, particularly FreeCodeCamp themselves. One needed to use the JSON
                            in the response to find the user's logo, official username, and current streaming
                            status. The elements generated with this information also had to link to the user's 
                            Twitch page. We were also given a sample list of streamers to use, some active all of
                            the time, and some did not have Twitch profiles. For the ones without profiles, we
                            had to output something to the effect of "userName no longer has an account."
                            <br><br>
                            To complete the project, I used jQuery to make the ajax call to the Twitch API. On the
                            first call to the API, I check whether the user has an account. If they don't, the name
                            of the non-existant user is sent to a function that handles the case where the user 
                            doesn't exit. If they do exist, then the data and username are sent to a different 
                            function that begins creating the division with the basic information. At the end of this 
                            function, a second call to the API is made looking for streaming information. This info
                            is then inserted into the element and finally the completed element is displayed on the 
                            screen.

                            Another project in the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development certification, this project must allow the user
                            to enter a search term and return Wikipedia articles in response. Each of these
                            articles must be linked to the actual article on Wikipedia. Additionally, there needed to be a prominent
                            link one can click on for a random Wikipedia article.<br><br>
                            I used the Wikipedia API to complete the project. jQuery is used to take the user's search term from the 
                            input field, encode it, and send an ajax request to the API that asks for 15 results with the needed 
                            information about each article in the JSON response. That response is then turned into a list of elements
                            that are appended to the page, each one linking to its full Wikpedia article.

                            Completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development certification, this project requires one to 
                            display the user's local weather and temperature, as well as an icon or background image that reflects
                            the local weather. There must also be a button that lets the user convert the temperature reading between
                            Fahrenheit and Celcius units.<br><br>I used the browser's Navigator interface to get the user's 
                            approximate lattitude and longitude and then used that data to get the user's local weather from the 
                            DarkSky.net API. Once the data is returned, the current weather icon string is used to determine what 
                            background to display to the user. The DarkSky.net API does reject CORS, but I was able to avoid this issue 
                            by using a heroku API.

                            This project was completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development certification. The objective
                            was to have a button that would display a random quote to the user each time it was pressed. There also 
                            had to be a second button that would allow the user to tweet the quote.<br><br>To complete this, I used 
                            an ajax call to QuotesOnDesign.com's REST API to retrieve a random quote. However, the quotes on their 
                            database may include HTML tags as well as unicode code point representations of characters. Additionaly, the quotes 
                            are sometimes too long to tweet or do not end in a punctuation, giving the idea that the quote may be 
                            incomplete. To address these issues, I wrote a function that removes all HTML tags and replaces the unicode 
                            code points with their corresponding characters. I also implemented conditional statements that make sure 
                            the quote is short enough to be tweetable and ends in a punctuation mark. Should a quote not meet one of 
                            those conditions, another call is made to the API for a new quote. The disadvantage of this is that it 
                            may take a while for a quote to load.

                            This project was completed for my "Intro to Programming Nanodegree" certificate from 
                            Udacity.com. For the final project, one had to choose one of five tracks (Front-End, 
                            Back-End, Data Analysis, iOS Development, or Android Development), go through a 
                            summarized section of that track and complete a project. I choose the Back-End track. 
                            <br><br>This project required me to build a database and Python script that could be 
                            used to manage a Swiss-Style tournament. In such as tournament, players are not 
                            eliminated after losing. Instead, each player is matched with another player with as 
                            close a win record as possible in the next round. It is assumed that an even number 
                            of players are involved. The database had to contain the names, id's, win/loss record, 
                            and matches played of the players. The python script had to be able to delete all of 
                            the players, add players, return each players' overall standings, update the database 
                            with the results of the latest matches, and return the match pairings for the next
                            round once the current round was completed. My script had to pass an additional python 
                            script of tests. I also had to write an acceptable README file for the files.
